"""Arms:
  A      : statement once in prompt, answer immediately (k=0; identical to B0/C0).
  B_k    : statement in prompt followed by k additional verbatim copies (user-supplied filler).
  C_k    : statement once in prompt; model must emit k verbatim copies, then the answer.
  DB_k   : statement in prompt followed by content-free filler (lines of dots) token-matched to k copies.
  DC_k   : statement once; model must emit the same token-matched filler, then the answer.
  NB/NC  : as DB/DC but filler lines are numbered (gives the model a counter; tokens still matched).
  XB/XC  : dot filler with k = the exact number of dot tokens (lines of 10, last line partial).
  YB     : as XB but the dots are placed BEFORE the problem statement (positional control; user-supplied only).
  CB/CC  : counting filler "1, 2, 3, ..., N" (as in Gould et al. 2026), k = N; user-supplied / model-emitted.
  RB     : k full verbatim copies of the statement appended to the prompt (user-supplied repeats; = arm B_k but
           allowed inside dose runs). Model-emitted repeats are arm C.
  PB/PC  : statement-prefix/repetition filler with k = target token count: full verbatim copies of the statement
           plus the first L lines of the next copy, L chosen so the o200k token count is closest to k.
  LB/KB  : semantic-but-unrelated filler, user-supplied only: a contiguous excerpt of ~k o200k tokens from an
           unrelated corpus (LB: prose, Pride and Prejudice; KB: Python source code), starting at a line boundary
           chosen deterministically from the problem id. See data/filler_corpora/.
Total tokens in context at answer time are matched between B_k and C_k; the only difference is
who produced the k copies. Instruction skeletons are kept as close as possible."""
